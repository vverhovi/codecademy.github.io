## Assignment ##
Challenge Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet

## Instructions ##
In this project, youâ€™ll be building your own reference cheat sheet to help you build more websites in the future! Although there are great places to learn HTML & CSS like Codecademy, the best reference for yourself is often your own notes and projects.

## Feature Requirements ##
- Project should document at least one HTML or CSS topic
- Use HTML tables to display content
- Create your own color scheme
- Custom styles for different tags

## Personal comment ##
Codecademy offered to make smth similar to this [table style website](https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/html-css-cheat-sheet/example/index.html). But I decided to make it more appealing to human eyes and made my option.
